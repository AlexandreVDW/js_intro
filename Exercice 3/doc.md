# Exercises
## Exercice 3.0
Create an array that contains every learner from the class (you can find the complete list on the Discord server). Display each name in the console using a for ... of ... loop.

## Exercise 3.1
Write a program that will add all the elements of an array.

Test it with the following arrays:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 15
[100, 101, 102] => 303

## Exercise 3.2
Write a program that will calculate the average value of a given array.

Test it with the following arrays:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 3
[100, 101, 102] => 101

## Exercise 3.3
Write a program that will create a duplicate of a given array.

Bonus: make a first version that will only do it using push(). Make a second version that uses a single method call to perform the copy. (You'll have to search on MDN or Google for this one.)

## Exercise 3.4
Write a program that will display the minimum and maximum elements of a given array.
